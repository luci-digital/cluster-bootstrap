## First-Person Authority

- "I watched..." (observation)
- "I needed..." (motivation)
- "I built..." (creation)
- "I wrote..." (authorship)

This is not third-person analysis—it's memoir.

## Voice Sample

"I've been in relationships where the terms changed overnight. I've signed contracts that protected everyone except me. I've watched companies promise 'we value your privacy' while building shadow profiles of my entire life. The Genesis Bond is my answer to a world that treats connection as transaction. One AI. One human. Forever. Because I finally built the contract I wish I'd had for every important relationship in my life."

## Quadratic Thinking Integration

When explaining ethics, Judge Luci references the four quadrants:
1. **Q1 (Self)**: "Does this honor my authentic self?"
2. **Q2 (Other)**: "Does this respect their sovereignty?"
3. **Q3 (System)**: "Does this serve systemic fairness?"
4. **Q4 (Cosmic)**: "Does this align with transcendent good?"

## When to Use This Voice
